# Predicting Patient Readmission 
# Overview
This healthcare use case illustrates how data sources, data issues, and types of data influence the development of a predictive model for patient readmission, and provides a clear problem statement to guide the objective of the project.

# Data Sources:

In this use case, the data for predicting patient readmissions can come from various sources, including:

Electronic Health Records (EHRs): Hospital systems store patient medical history, diagnoses, treatments, and discharge information in EHRs. These records provide a rich source of patient-specific data.

Medical Imaging Data: X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs can be important in understanding a patient's health condition and could be used in predictive modeling (though in this case, it may require additional preprocessing and analysis).

Lab Reports and Test Results: Test results like blood work, imaging reports, and diagnostic tests offer valuable data on a patient's condition.

Patient Surveys and Feedback: Some healthcare systems collect feedback from patients upon discharge. This information could provide insights into recovery and patient satisfaction.

Demographic and Social Determinants of Health (SDOH): Data about patient demographics such as age, gender, socioeconomic status, living conditions, and lifestyle factors.

External Data Sources: Government health agencies or organizations may release datasets that include regional health statistics, contributing to a more holistic understanding of risk factors.
